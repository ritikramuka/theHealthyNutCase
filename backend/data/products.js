    description:
      `Mamra almonds (badam) is an exotic nut that grows in
      Iran and Afghanistan. 
      Power-packed with nutrition, they are the richest source of minerals, vitamins, and proteins.
      They are different from other almonds, namely Californians and Gurbandis, since they are cultivated organically without using chemicals.
      Their small size and concave shape can characterize them.
      They have multiple health benefits and add a delicious crunch to a variety of food items. 
      Store in a cool, dry place or an airtight container and preferably refrigerate after opening.
